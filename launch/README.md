# Launch

Launch files are essentially start up scripts for Lunabot. Since several nodes need to be started up for Lunabot to run, we write them all down in these launch files.

## Important Launch Files

While you are welcome to create launch files that you think are useful, you are absolutely not allowed to push changes to the following launch files without permission.

1. `arch.py`
